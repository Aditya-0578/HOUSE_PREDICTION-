## Project Overview

**HOUSE_PREDICTION-** is designed to estimate the selling prices of houses based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes. The project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to provide insights and accurate predictions.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Prediction on new/unseen data

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya-0578/HOUSE_PREDICTION-.git
   cd HOUSE_PREDICTION-
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset:**  
   Place your dataset (CSV format) in the appropriate directory, or use the one provided.

2. **Run the main script:**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will start the training process and generate predictions.

3. **View results:**  
   Check the output files or console logs for model performance and predicted values.
